# Basic to semi-advanced SAXS analysis #

## _Welcome_  ##
### _This repository contains a series of scripts used for processing SAXS data. Each script/class should have a description within the script as well as here in the README file. Note, these functions are continually updated and improved for bug fixes. Therefore, if issues arise, please post them to the GitHub issues page here or contact Robert Miller (rcm347@cornell.edu)_ ###
